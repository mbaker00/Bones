== Bone Surname in Madison County Kentucky
=== Introduction Madison County

Below I have collected records primarily from Madison County, Kentucky, pertaining to the Bone Surname in early county records. There are two or more John Bone adults in these early Madison County records given they are listed separately in tax lists and on a few occasions with a distinguishing suffix. It seems useful to refer to various Bone individuals based on their classification in Dr. Robert G. Bone's 1972 history. The families that follow are found in Chart H and likely those in Chart A. In that case and if Dr. Bone's tree of early Bones is correct, these two John Bones were probably 2nd cousin. Other Bone's in these records are William, Thomas

It is unfortunate that Dr. Bone and the family historians researching the Bone family supplying him material seemed unaware of much of the Madison County, Kentucky records. Occasionally they are included in the research, but the extent of at least two branches of the family living significant years at this location seems to have been unknown. Had these records been know before the publication, I think many errors would have been avoided and a different timeline and relationships would have resulted. There are many Bone descendants who are listed in print and online genealogies as being born in Wilson County, TN, whose family where actually living in Madison County, Kentucky, at the time of their birth.

==== John Bone (1762 PA - 1842 KY) and Hugh Bone (1764 PA - 1846 KY)
*John Bone* (1762-1842 Chart H, H1), of most interest to me, is the John Bone, son of Thomas Bone, who first married Jane Hill and later married Catherine Adams. He is supposed to be the son of Thomas Bone (H) and Mary McCreary. He first appears in this county in 1789, matching the timeline he gives in his pension application for service in the revolutionary ware. For several years he appears to be the only John Bone in the county records. He is once listed as John Bone Jr in a tax record. This John Bone (H1) purchased his property from Robert Adams on Silver Creek, part of 500 acres that included the mouth of Taylors Branch. Robert Adams property conflicted with several adjacent land claims and court cases regarding this property continued into the 1820s, affecting John Bone (H1), even after moving to Muhlenberg County, Kentucky.
This location is easily found within current day Madison County, Kentucky.
Based on some online genealogies, that I'm not able to validate, Catherine may be the sister of the Robert Adams who sold the property to John Bone while he was married to Jane Hill. It seems Robert Adams and many of his family later moved to Christian County, Kentucky, which contributed to part of modern Hopkins County and Muhlenberg County.
The Adams family move occurred while John Bone still lived in Madison County.
In 1808 John Bone married Catherine Adams in Christian County.
The location of his second wife's family in Western Kentucky before him likely explains why, while still living in Madison County, he married in Christian County then He and his new wife returned to Madison until their final move to Muhlenberg County in 1810.
This move would have put John and Catherine both near her family and John at least near his in-laws and eventually near his brother or other relatives. Matthew Adams, supposedly brother to Catherine Adams, is bondsman on the marriage certificate of John Bone to Catherine Adams in Christian County, Kentucky, in 1808. John Bone appears to have lost the majority of his land holding due to the aforementioned land disputes. Some of this timeline is directly supported by John Bone's pension application submitted while living in Muhlenberg County Kentucky. John Bone died about 1842. Prior publications and online genealogies have cited an 1832 death date for John Bone which appears clearly a mistake given the pension records and county records.

The following is a proposed timeline from Madison County for John Bone born in York County, PA in 1762 and who died in Muhlenberg County, KY, in 1842:

 * 1810 and following, John Bone is found mostly in the records of Muhlenberg County, Kentucky, through 1842
 * 1822 John Bone continues legal disputes with Green Clay over land lost in Madison County.


*Hugh Bone* (H2) found in these records, based on a reliable appearing genealogies by others, is the second son of Thomas Bone (H) previously mentioned and brother to John Bone (H1). Hugh Bone (H2) is found in the Madison County records from 1795 through 1802. In 1802 Hugh Bone and his wife Mary sell their 100 acres purchased from Joseph Kennedy in 1795. Hugh and family make their way to Wilson County, Tennessee, in 1803. Here again is an example where the history of this branch of the family is incorrect in Dr. Bone's publication. Thomas Bone (H) and his children are frequently described as moving from Iredell County, NC, to Wilson County, TN, when instead they moved to Madison County, KY and lived there many years before moving to TN or some seem never to have moved through TN. While Hugh's brother John moved to Muhlenberg County in Western Kentucky about 1810 or 1811, Hugh and family lived many years in Wilson County, Tennessee, before also moving to Western Kentucky. Hugh Bone and his family settled in Hopkins County, adjacent to Muhlenberg County.

* Iredell County, NC
** 1788-09-05 Hugh Bone from D. Boyd 210 acres
** 1793-02-14 Hugh Bone to John Woodside Deed 210 acres
* Madison County, KY

The link between brothers John and Hugh Bone to father Thomas Bone and other family members is supported by a letter written by Hugh Bone's grandson to a cousin c. 1885. In this letter he gives account of the children of Thomas Bone and some of their descendants to the cousin researching the family tree. See Transcription later. Hugh is also listed as bondsman on a marriage certificate for John Bone and later Hugh is a witness the the pension application for his brother John.

==== Other Bones
The other *John Bone* in these Madison County records shows up in tax records by 1794 or 1795 and owned 200 acres of land between the waters of Silver Creek and Paint Lick Creek. This was purchased from Green Clay in 1795. This John Bone sold the property in two halves. The first half was sold to Daniel Tuder in 1798 and the last half to Bloomer Tuder in 1801. It is possible, seeing how the tax records list this 200 acres split into two 100 acres for a John and William Bone, that this property was shared between the two. This could mean William was a son or other close relative to this John. Even though at times part of the property is listed with William Bone, the property eventually sold under the name of John Bone. This John Bone's property, as well as I can tell from mapping out numerous land records from original surveys and deeds, is about 2.5 to 3 miles west of the other John Bone's property. With available records and relying on Dr. Bone's publication, I think this could be John Bone from Chart A referred to as John C. Bone (1745-1805, A4 ). The William associated with him could be son William Bone (A41). Supporting this is the witness of a William Bone and Agness Bone to a will in 1800. William (A41) son of John C. (A4) is supposed to have married Agnes McGuire in 1793 in the county.

Also, this John Bone could be an uncle or older cousin to John Bone (1762-1842, H1) who married Jane Hill and later Catherine Adams. John (H1), the brother of Hugh Bone (H2) and son of Thomas Bone (H) is listed once as John Bone Jr. while the other is listed twice in tax records as John Bone Sr. The senior and junior titles may have only been applied to distinguish an older from younger person by the same name in a nearby location. It should not be assumed that the suffix Senior means the person had a child by the same name or that Junior means the subject had a father of the same name. During this period the titles could be used without any kinship implied.

Since (H1) John Bone's uncle John A. Bone Sr. (E of Chart E) is reported to have died c. 1787, he is unlikely this John Bone in Madison County. His 2nd cousin John C. Bone (A4) at this time is the best fit. His departure from the Madison County records in 1801 fits with the genealogies of others.

Regarding the William Bone in these records, there is a high possibility it being John C. Bone's (A4) son William (A41). John C. Bone has been reported to have a brother William, but no significant data is available. William is physically immediately adjacent to John Bone's property.

**Thomas Bone** in these records, without additional data is harder to place in the family tree. Possibilities include John Bone's father Thomas (H) and John's brother Thomas Bone Jr (H4). There is more than one Thomas Bone in these records so both might be represented.

In Dr. Bone's history, Thomas Bone (H) is listed as possibly dying around 1796 and possibly in TN or NC. However, there is no record found so far in any state that suggest this. It is true that Thomas Bone of Iredell, NC, sells all his land in 1794 in two halves. There seem to be erroneous statements in the history that Thomas kept some of his original land but that is contradicted by the deed records. There is a statement in the history that a son-in-law sold the last of his land in 1796, suggesting Thomas had moved or died. I don't find any record of this either. The 1794 deeds of sale are later proved in court in 1795 and 1796 but the sale date is 1794 by Thomas. I think some have confused the proving of the deeds in court with additional land sales. Dr. Bone includes statements from family that claim Thomas died in TN and others saying he undoubtedly died in NC. Unless other evidence is found, I think it is as likely that Thomas moved to Kentucky like his two oldest sons and could have died there. Consider that Thomas sold his property in Iredell, NC, in 1794 and is not found in records thereafter. Then in 1795 a Thomas Bone is in Madison County, KY, as are his oldest sons Hugh and John. One Thomas there is even recorded as Thomas Bone Sr. Thomas' son Thomas Bone (H4) would have been old enough in 1795 to be listed in records. The Madison County, KY, records of Thomas Bone might refer to both father and son, since we don't know when Thomas the father died or what year Thomas the son could have moved to Kentucky.

 Since Madison County, Kentucky, records have been a large blind spot for Bone researchers, it shouldn't be discounted that Thomas Bone Senior (H) might have lived past 1796 to circa 1800. His place of death remains unknown. There seem to be few other candidates for man listed as Thomas Sr. in the immediate family of John Bone (H1) and John Bone (A4). John's (H1) son Thomas would be too young for these records. Thomas Sr. if not John's father then is likely a cousin. Thomas Bone appears in the Madison County records by 1794 as a witness to a will along with a John Bone. Thomas is listed without a suffix in 1795, 1796 and 1797. In 1799, 1801 and 1802 a Thomas is listed as Thomas Bone Sr. In 1802 Thomas Bone Jr. shows up in the tax list and Abner Bone the same year. The Thomas Bone Jr., might be Thomas Bone (H4) son of Thomas Bone (H). Hugh Bone, Abner Bone and the Thomas Bone listed as Senior disappear from the Madison County records after 1802. If Thomas Senior is the father (H1), this could indicate he died in Kentucky about 1802. Looking at the ages of these individuals and their children or household dependents, along with the enumerations in tax and census records, I believe support the above consideration.

==== Work in Progress
There are records from Madison County Circuit Session Court cases that I have yet to transcribe that I haven't found available online. I hope to locate these case folders the next time I visit the Kentucky State Archives or view online once the films are digitized at FamilySearch.org. As mentioned above, some of these may be Boone family members instead of Bone.

==== 1794 Madison County Tax Lists - Middle District
The microfilm copy at FamilySearch.org for the section of Madison County, Middle District, containing the Bone families is mostly unreadable. The names William Bone and John Bone are present. The suffix for John Bone is either Snr or Jnr, I think most likely senior. He is listed with 200 acres. This may be the John Bone listed as senior in the dividing area between Paint Lick and Silver Creeks and associated with William Bone.  Other names are unreadable. I found no Bones in the other districts.

[NOTE]
Regarding this plot of land, I would consider this the home place for John Bone (1762 PA - 1842 KY) while in Madison, Kentucky. The exact location is complicated by the accuracy of the original surveys and the significant amount of conflicting land ownership. There is overlap of Robert Adams original 500 acres with surveys belonging to others including a 1400 acres survey for William Mayo who sold his land to Green Clay, a 500 acre survey for John Bryant and 1025 acre survey for William Robinson. There are entries in court cases and survey records recording these land interferences. While I don't have all court case files showing the outcome of the litigation, it appears from my review of the surveys and deeds that this holding was significantly paired down over the years with area lost to competing claims. It is possible John Bone lost most of his original purchase by 1810 to plaintiffs. This may have factored into his move from Madison County to Muhlenberg County. This link shows the approximate location of John Bone's property https://www.google.com/maps/place/37°42'28.4%22N+84°23'04.4%22W/@37.707875,-84.3867467,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x0:0x0!7e2!8m2!3d37.7078753!4d-84.3845576[link to location in Google maps]

This is the plat included in the Kentucky Secretary of State's record for the grant to Robert Adams under Old Virginia patent number 2368. This is the appearance prior to reductions from competing claims. There also appear to be inaccuracies regarding its position relative to the course of Silver Creek at its North edge.

[NOTE]
Research Note: This William Bone, and in other records collected here, may be the William Bone in Robert G. Bone's history labeled A41 William Bone 1769-1830, married Agnes McGuire (1772-1848), moved to Madison Co., Ky. in 1789 and Warren Co., Ohio, in 1801. I have not found William Bone in the Madison County records after 1801, so this would match with Robert G. Bone's claim. He has William as the son of John C. Bone (A4) born 1747. He also lists sons James Bone, John Bone, Elam Bone and Cyrus Bone. The ages of the sons of William Bone, as listed by Dr. Bone, fit well into the census records in this county. Due to significant errors in Robert Bone's research, I cannot vouch for the accuracy of those relationships.

[NOTE]
Who is the Thomas Bone witness to this deed. John (H1) and Hugh (H2) Bone had children named Thomas but, even by 1810, they would have been to young to be a witness. Is it possible John's brother Thomas Bone was still in the area or had returned?

[^note1]: This 300 acres is from a survey of 500 acres for Robert Adams on Old Virginia Patent #2368 http://apps.sos.ky.gov/land/nonmilitary/patentseries/vaandokpatents/DisplayPrintableImage.aspx?DocDb=VIRGINIA%20PATENTS&DocTitle=VA%202368.0&Title=VA%202368.0&Description=ADAMS%2c+ROBERT&Page=3&ScaleFactor=2&CompressionFactor=60[link], surveyed July 29th 1784. The patent was issued to Robert Adams December 2nd 1785. The property as recorded includes the mouth of Taylors branch of Silver Creek in Madison County, Kentucky. This survey interferes with a larger survey for Green Clay resulting in a court case. I have not yet obtained all the court records to determine the outcome of the case.

[^note-hawkins-1]: There are landowners by the names of Nathan Hawkins and Nicholas Hawkins adjacent to to John Bone's 300 acres to the North and South.
